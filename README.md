# FirestoreSmartChat

App that displays use of Cloud Firestore for chat-like instant messaging.

Uses no real architecture pattern, and makes use of Firebase Authentication on top of Firestore.

If you want to run this app, you'll need to connect it to one of your own Firebase projects and download your own google-services.json to add to the app.

If you don't know how to connect your app to Firebase, here you go.
